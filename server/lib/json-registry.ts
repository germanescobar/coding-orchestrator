/*
 * Shared safeguards for the orchestrator's JSON-on-disk registries
 * (worktrees, terminal tabs, schedules index, …).
 *
 * Issue #332: the previous `readRegistry` / `writeRegistry` helpers had
 * three concrete unsafe behaviors that combined to silently wipe the
 * registry:
 *
 *   1. `writeRegistry` used `fs.writeFile`, which truncates the
 *      destination before the new JSON is fully written — readers can
 *      observe an empty or partially written file.
 *   2. Registry read-modify-write operations were not serialized, so
 *      two writers could interleave or a writer could race a reader.
 *   3. `readRegistry` swallowed every error (parse or I/O) and returned
 *      `[]`, which callers like `ensureMainInRegistry` then persisted
 *      back as "the new registry contents" — a transient parse failure
 *      became a catastrophic data loss.
 *
 * This module addresses all three:
 *
 *   - Atomic write via `write-to-tmp-then-rename`. POSIX rename within
 *     the same directory is atomic at the filesystem level, so a reader
 *     either sees the old contents or the new contents — never a
 *     truncated file.
 *   - A per-file promise-chain mutex so concurrent read-modify-write
 *     calls in the same Node process are serialized. The orchestrator
 *     is a single-process app, so process-level locking is sufficient.
 *   - A backup of the last known good file (`<file>.bak`) maintained on
 *     every successful write, plus an explicit distinction between
 *     `ENOENT` (first-run → return the default) and other failures
 *     (parse error → throw, after attempting backup recovery).
 *
 * The helpers are intentionally generic. They don't know about Worktree
 * or TerminalTab — they just store/retrieve JSON. Higher-level modules
 * pick a default value (empty array / empty record) and a `key` to
 * serialize against.
 */
