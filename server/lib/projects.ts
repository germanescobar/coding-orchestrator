/**
 * Find the project that owns the given filesystem path. The orchestrator
 * already thinks of a session as "pinned to a worktree, owned by a
 * project", and a session's shell is usually running in one of two
 * on-disk locations:
 *
 *   1. A Controller-created worktree under
 *      `orchestratorHome()/worktrees/<projectId>/<name>` — this is where
 *      `worktreePath()` (paths.ts) and `findWorktreeByPath` (worktrees.ts)
 *      know about.
 *   2. The project's `path` itself (i.e. the main worktree's root, or any
 *      other directory the user opened in the project).
 *
 * The function tries the worktree-aware lookup first and only falls back
 * to a `project.path` prefix match when no worktree owns the path. This
 * means a session running inside a Controller-created worktree — the
 * exact case the CLI's optional-`<project>` resolver was built for —
 * resolves to the right project. (Initial PR review from Codex on #298.)
 *
 * Returns `null` when no project owns the path. The `cwd` is resolved
 * before comparison so symlinks and `.`/`..` segments don't bypass the
 * prefix check.
