/*
 * Issue #332: registry loss under concurrent reads and writes.
 *
 * The previous `readRegistry` / `writeRegistry` pair in
 * `server/lib/worktrees.ts` had three concrete unsafe behaviors that
 * combined to wipe the worktrees.json registry:
 *
 *   1. `writeRegistry` used `fs.writeFile`, which truncates the
 *      destination before the new JSON is fully written. A reader
 *      during the truncate-to-rename window saw an empty file.
 *   2. Registry read-modify-write operations were not serialized. Two
 *      writers could interleave their read and write phases.
 *   3. `readRegistry` swallowed every error (including parse failures)
 *      and returned `[]`. Callers like `ensureMainInRegistry` then
 *      persisted the empty array back as the new contents — a single
 *      transient parse failure became a full registry wipe.
 *
 * The fix is a per-file mutex plus atomic write-via-rename plus
 * distinct error handling for ENOENT vs parse failure. These tests
 * exercise all three fixes end-to-end via the public worktrees API.

/*
 * Deterministic reproduction of the catastrophic registry loss from
 * issue #332. The original report described a window where:
 *
 *   - `writeRegistry()` truncated `worktrees.json` with `fs.writeFile`,
 *     then spent several milliseconds writing the new JSON.
 *   - A concurrent reader called `readRegistry()`, observed an empty or
 *     truncated file, and `JSON.parse` threw.
 *   - `readRegistry()` caught the error and returned `[]`.
 *   - The caller (`getProjectWorktrees` → `ensureMainInRegistry`) then
 *     called `writeRegistry([mainRow])`, persisting a main-only
 *     registry as the new contents.
 *
 * We inject the same window by installing a slow `writeFile` via the
 * `_setJsonRegistryFs` seam. With the old code this would reproduce
 * the wipe; with the new code (atomic write + per-file mutex) the
 * reader either sees the pre-write contents or the post-write
 * contents, but never an empty file, and the mutex prevents the
 * reader from writing back a stale snapshot while the slow writer is
 * still mid-flight.
